Arch Bytes is a long-term series of articles on software architecture. The focus is practical: decisions, trade-offs, and patterns that hold up in real systems.

What you can expect here:

- Decision records, architecture rationale, and trade-off analysis.
- Boundaries, modularity, and pragmatic service extraction.
- Reliability, performance, and operational design.
- Integration patterns, data flows, and event-driven systems.
- Governance: security, compliance, and sustainable documentation.
- Code snippets, diagrams, and curated references when they add clarity.
